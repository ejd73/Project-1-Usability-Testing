I have taken many coding and writing courses, and I primarily enjoy courses about combining both. My hobbies outside of class include playing video games, discovering new music, going to metal shows, and doing makeup art. </h2>

 <h1>Field of Study</h1>
  <h2>The Digital Narrative and Interactive Design major allowed me to find my place in the world. This major combines both the School of Computing and Information's technological coursework with Dietrich School of Arts and Science's narrative coursework. I have always been a creative person who is interested in technology, and this major allows me to utilize both of these aspects. I want to use the skills from this major, along with my computer science minor, to create video games as part of a game development team. Thanks to the DNID cirriculum and a game jam, I have already created two video games, and I can't wait to make more! </h2>

  <h2>I took this course because I really enjoy human-computer interaction, so I thought it would be interesting to learn more about UX design. I have taken the Human-Centered Systems course at Pitt, and our final project was to design an app to improve everyday life. I really learned a lot from that course, and I enjoyed creating the UX design of an app prototype. In the future, I see myself applying knowledge from this course to my games that I work on, making them intuitive and aesthetically pleasing for the users. </h2>
